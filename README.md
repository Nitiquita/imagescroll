SCROLL 

To run this page open the index.html page in your browser. 

Using JavaScript to lazy load images requires keeping track of how far the user has scrolled. Once the user passes a certain scroll location, I added the image to the DOM. 

This can also be done using the axios library, which makes Ajax requests easier to create. With a frontend library like React, and axios, lazy loading would be easy to create. The axios request would then fetch the image once the user scrolled past a certain point on the page.
